# Repository description

In this repository I collected just few of the projects that I had the chance to collaborate with/personally develop during the attendance to the MSc in Data Science held at La Sapienza UniversitÃ  di Roma.


### Folders content
1. __ExplainableML__:
    > Together with other colleagues, we built our own datasets containing accelerometer's data of basketball free shots.
    > After the implementation of several ML architectures, the analysis dived into their interpretation.
    > Theoretical analysis in the report provided.
2. __CL__:
    > A Continous Learning task: a task incremental setup is simulated, key of the project is the maintenance of good performances
    > on older tasks upon the arrival of new ones.  
3. __Optimizers__:
    > A practical approach to optimizers built to be faster and more stable than the NesterovAcceleratedGradient.            
4. __ImageClassification__:
    > A practical approach to image classification trying to leverage low-level pixel's Shannon Information to increase performances.
5. __NLP__:
    > Tackling a typical NLP task (text classification) with a shallow classifier without the usage of RNNs/Transformers architectures. 
6. __Algorithms__:
    > Leveraging fingerprint hashing and LSH bucketing to build an efficient song identifier.
